/**
 * KyberSwap aggregator client — best-route swaps across ALL of the chain's liquidity (every
 * DEX, fee tier, hooked pool, and multi-hop), so acquiring a token never bleeds fee + price
 * impact from buying on a single thin pool. Adapted from labrinyang/lp-terminal (kyber.ts +
 * kyberExec.ts) for a server-side ethers wallet.
 *
 * SECURITY: kyber calldata is opaque, so every swap passes 4 gates before broadcast:
 *   1. build.routerAddress must equal the whitelisted router (tx.to is ALWAYS the whitelist)
 *   2. tx value == amountIn for native ETH, else 0
 *   3. built amountIn == requested amountIn (spend integrity)
 *   4. built amountOut >= fresh quote − slippage (no execution drift)
